# Placeholder for app icon
# You should replace this with a proper icon file (icon.png or icon.icns)
# 
# For macOS app icons, you need:
# - icon.png (at least 512x512 pixels)
# - icon.icns (generated from PNG using tools like Image2icon or iconutil)
#
# The icon should be placed in the assets/ directory
